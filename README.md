# Mental Health Treatment Prediction

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict mental health treatment needs among employees. Utilizing the Mental Health in Tech survey dataset from Kaggle, the data underwent preprocessing and analysis to evaluate multiple models, including Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Trees. The AdaBoost Classifier emerged as the top-performing model, achieving an accuracy of 81.22% and an AUC score of 0.87. The project demonstrates the potential of AI in facilitating early intervention and improving workplace mental health and productivity.
